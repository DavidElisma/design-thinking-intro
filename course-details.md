# Course description
**Design Thinking** is human-centric. It puts people first, before thinking about technology, to enable them to achieve more.  According to Tim Brown, CEO of IDEO, Design Thinking is "a human-centered approach to innovation" that allows people across any industry to deliver stronger and more meaningful - even revolutionary - products.  In this course, we'll focus on the first phase of Design Thinking - Empathize.
