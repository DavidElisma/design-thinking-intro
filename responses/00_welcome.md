# Welcome!

Hello @{{user.login}}, I'm so excited to teach you about Design Thinking! ðŸ˜„

This repository will be a working website that you can publish as your own Design Thinking landing page.

As we work, we'll create a resource that others can use within your organization. This repository will be useful even after you finish this course.

This is how this course will move along:

- Every new issue or pull request will start with a challenge question
- You'll answer the challenge question _(don't worry, there are no right or wrong answers!)_
- The question will highlight the importance of each topic in Design Thinking



### Challenge question
Now let's try your first challenge question!
