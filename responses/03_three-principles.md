This pull request is about the five phases of Design Thinking.  These phases are based on three core principles.  

So far we've learned that Design Thinking is, at it's heart, User-Centric.  We've also talked about the concept of putting a Minimum Viable Product in the hands of users quickly in order to gain insight for solutioning.  Despite Dilbert's example, the designer must always remain focused on the needs of the user.
