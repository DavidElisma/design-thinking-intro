### Answer :crystal_ball:

**User-Centric** design enables the continous delivery of value to users. This means that putting a good, functional, tool in the hands of users quickly is more valuable than delivering a perfect tool when it's too late. 

Design Thinking accomplishes this by establishing the boundaries of the product early through the definition of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
Once the MVP is delivered, the team continues to iterate on the solution, incrementally improving and enhancing it by leveraging continous feedback from users and stakeholders.

In Design Thinking, human-centered design begins with Desirability.  The convergence of user need,  business viability, and technical & financial feasibility outlines the solution.
